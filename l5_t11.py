"""

Write Python class representing an IPv4 address.
The IP address class should be instantiated by a four-item list (where the first item in the list is the highest octet in the address) and a mask (should be represented by an integer of value 0 to 32)
the class should have at least the following methods:
•	method getNetwork() returns a list representing the network portion of the IP address
•	method getMask() return a list representing the mask as four octets (i.e. 255.255....)
•	method getAddress() returns a list representing the address
Also implement __str__ to print the IP address
